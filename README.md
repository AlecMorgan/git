## Download raw data from the command line

```
wget https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip
```

If you don't have `wget`, try `brew install wget`. If you don't have [`brew](https://brew.sh/)`, run:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
